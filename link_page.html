<body><h1>Resources for searching about Origami</h1>
<fieldset><p>Click <a href="https://www.google.com/">here</a> to find out more about the art of origami.</p>
<p>You can also check out <a href="http://www.origami-instructions.com/">Origami Instructions</a>, a great website with lots of info about how to start an origami project.
<ul>
	<li>This website is really easy to navigate; they provide a comprehensive list of links around the website to the left of the main content, and you can use Google to search the site at the top.</li>
	<li>It includes video, and user submitted photos on the home page.</li>
	<li>The design is very simple, but visually it is very clear as well. Your eye moves around the screen naturally, and it is always clear what you are looking at (like a link list, main content feed, or small blurbs of information on the side). The whole thing is topped off by the website name and address, plus their slogan.</li>
	<li>I really like the page overall. The only thing I might change is adding borders around the main content, or giving it its own background color, so you start reading the page in the middle (my eye first went to the link list on the left).</li>
